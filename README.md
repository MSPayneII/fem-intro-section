## Overview

### The challenge

Build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

My goal was to code as if the challenge was to build an entire website. I've recently started learning Nextjs so I used this challenge as an opportunity to practice.

Your users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
